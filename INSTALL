The framework is intended to be used with Linux. The instructions in this section have been tested on a fresh standard installation of Ubuntu 16.04.

The following actions need to be taken to prepare and run the framework:

1. Download and extract the framework. Enter the framework's folder.

2. Make sure that the COMPILER variable in Makefile contains the correct path to version 4.9 or newer of g++ (that's when g++ began to fully support regular expressions).

3. Install xlib:
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev

4. Install cairo:
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev

5. Make sure that the CAIRO_PATH variable in Makefile contains the correct path to cairo.h.

6. Download and extract the Boost library. The framework has been tested with version 1.61.0 of Boost.

7. Set the BOOST_PATH variable in Makefile to point to the Boost directory.

8. Install ncurses:
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

That's it! Now it's time to check the framework out by running the examples from the video demo!
